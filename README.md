# Project Proposal - Student Alcohol Consumption
By James McCutcheon, Emily Tao, Sean Campbell, and Akhila Bhamidipati

## Overview
>It is well understood that binge drinking has a negative effect on the adolescent brain. Effects include [damaged brain tissue](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122765890), which impacts thinking and memory, as well as decreased function in the liver and [heart](http://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/alcohol-and-heart-health). According to [this article](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics) from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the World Health Organization reported in 2012 that alcohol was a contributing factor in over two-hundred injuries and diseases, including multiple types of cancer and liver cirrhosis. With all of these risks, it is important to protect teenagers and young adults by addressing the underlying causes of drinking. However, the challenge lies in detecting those that are at risk for dangerous drinking behaviors so that personalized assistance can be given.  


### Our Data Set
>Our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption/home) was found on Kaggle, and contains social, gender, and study data from secondary school students in Portugal. The data was collected in 2008 and was presented at the 5th Future Business Technology Conference by P. Cortez and A. Silva. The given dataset contains data from thirty difference features about students at a school in Portugal, and was presented in two different datasets; one dataset contained students from a math course, and the other dataset contained students from a Portuguese language course. There were some students that were present in both datasets. The features included in the data include workday alcohol and weekend alcohol consumption, but also other variables related to the student's life such as grades from three periods of the course, mother's/father's job, family size, and more. The code for our project can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jamesbmc/370-final-project). 

### Our Purpose
>Our group hopes to detect students that are at risk of engaging in dangerous drinking behavior so that the students can receive the assistance and guidance they need. Early detection in groups who are at high risk for unhealthy alcohol habits is essential due to the vast array of medical and mental issues that can arise from certain adolescent drinking habits.  We define a student who is at risk for dangerous drinking behavior as fitting into the 4 or 5 category (high or very-high consumption) for workday or weekend alcohol consumption. The major challenges in our report revolve around deciding which factors are the biggest contributors to unhealthy alcohol consumption and how we will use these factors to determine which students are at risk for these detrimental alcohol habits. 

### Our Team
>Our group is composed of four aspiring software engineers with a passion for learning and data science. We are all very interested in helping the community by exploring relevant datasets, and hope that our findings in this report will be able to help detect when students are at risk for unhealthy drinking habits and will lead to schools and the community being able to assist such students if needed.
